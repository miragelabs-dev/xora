# 🚀 Decentralized Social Network

Welcome to our Decentralized Twitter Clone built with Chopin Framework and Celestia! 🌐✨ This project aims to create a censorship-resistant, secure, and scalable social network.

## 🏆 Why This Project?
Existing social networks are either centralized (X) or don't fully inherit blockchain security (Farcaster). Our solution leverages Chopin Framework + Celestia to ensure true decentralization while remaining scalable.

- 🔹 Next.js ⚡ (Frontend framework)
- 🔹 SQL 🗄️ (Database for structured data)
